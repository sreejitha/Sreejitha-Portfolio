css/styles.css -> contains the styling for the project
images/ contains all the images in this project

# verified html and css against html and css validators whose links were shared in the Project details
# have gone by mockup to some extent but chosen how content is to be displayed for different devices
# Most of the images are my personal ones, however 2 have been taken from Wikimedia (Which has a creative common license)
ATTRIBUTES
#Udacity logo has been taken from the website.
# Hamburger and navigation menu code was taken from the udacity html/css exercise solution in one of the lessons

Re-submission
# Used picture element with srcset. Used the media attribute inside the html instead of css, as was shown in an reference doc from code-review. Not sure if you can define srcset for different viewports inside css, so took this approach.
